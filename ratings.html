        <p>This matters because companies can be forced by law to give customers’ data to intelligence agencies. Other known methods by which these agencies can get customers’ data include coercion, hacking, planting an employee, or simply asking nicely. I’ve used the term “intelligence agencies” to refer to any government agency.</p>
        <p>Note: I have considered “customers’ data” here to mean customers’ content/messages (data, not metadata). Wickr, for example, does cooperate with law enforcement agencies — as all companies must — but they can only hand over metadata because the content is encrypted (and they don’t have the keys).</p>
        <p>Red = The company has been implicated in giving customers’ data to intelligence agencies. This is proven by evidence.</p>
        <p>Yellow = The company has been implicated in giving customers’ data to intelligence agencies. There is no direct evidence, but the source is reputable.</p>

        <p>However, in saying that, I assume that Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have all granted government backdoors to their apps for intelligence agencies. But apart from Microsoft, there is no proof that I could find.</p>

        <p>Red = Company does not design its systems to collect minimal customer information, or does not have strong encryption/security controls; or does not have a simple, readable privacy policy and terms & conditions. Or the company is known to cooperate with legal (or informal) requests for customer information. Or the company’s business model relies upon users’ data.</p>

        <p>Red = Funded by a company/person that/who is well-connected to, or well-known for, collecting customers’ data. Or they are known for collecting customers’ data or cooperating with the authorities when it comes to requesting customers’ data.</p>

        <p>Red = No, users must provide some kind of contact details such as an email address or cellphone number. (I’m aware that you could get an anonymous email address or even cellphone numbers. However, I’m not considering workarounds. Even these <em>could</em> be traced.)</p>

        <p>(Hashes are irreversible, one-way encryption functions that can give each cellphone number or email address a unique value that is essentially gibberish. Your cellphone number or email address is hashed on your device, then uploaded to the directory server.

        <p>However, how do you know that you have been “matched” with the correct person? That the company hasn’t matched you with someone else (e.g., an intelligence agent)? This is especially important the <em>first</em> time that you are “matched”.</p>

        <p>In order to ensure that you’re talking to whom you believe you are, it’s important that apps support the verification of users’ fingerprints. A fingerprint is a representation of your identity that’s bound to your encryption keys. If you cannot manually verify fingerprints within the app — by scanning a QR code, or by publishing your fingerprint, or by sending your fingerprint via another medium, or simply reading it over the phone — then your messages could be intercepted by what is called a “man in the middle (MITM)” attack.</p>
        <p>Alice is sending messages to Bob. Well, she thinks she is sending messages to Bob; but actually, she is sending messages to Eve, who reads them, and then passes them on to Bob. Neither Alice nor Bob realize this is happening.</p>
        <p>Verifying fingerprints ensures that this cannot occur.</p>
        <p>Red = No.</p>
        <p>Green = Yes.</p>

        <p>When using most messaging apps, you must/can provide a phone number, username, or email address. If a friend of yours has that phone number or email address in their contacts list, the app can automatically add your friend to your contacts in the app itself. (Or perhaps you must add their username manually.) That’s how these messaging apps know which of your friends is using it, too.</p>
        <p>When first adding a contact, it’s possible that a directory service could “match” you with the incorrect person, either maliciously or by mistake. This could mean that while you believe that you are talking to a friend of yours, you are in fact talking to an intelligence agency. Manually verifying each other’s fingerprint wouldn’t raise any concerns since the intelligence agency would be using a valid fingerprint.</p>
        <p>This is one way in which Threema has absolutely nailed mutual identification without a directory service. Each person can scan a QR code in the app — either by being physically in the same place, or by each person publishing their QR code somewhere on the Internet. Each person can then manually add the other without the need of the directory service.</p>
        <p>Likewise, a directory service means that a third party’s device could be trusted. The same functionality that enables iMessage to send all of your messages to all of your authorized devices could be used to send all of your messages to an untrusted device without you knowing.</p>
        <p>Note: This is arguably the biggest weakness in all messaging apps. Even if you’ve manually added a contact, you still must trust that the directory service isn’t doing anything malicious. This could include adding an unauthorized device to your account, giving another user access to your account (the same way in which you can use multiple devices), or temporarily matching you with another user. This is why being alerted when a user’s fingerprint changes is so important. Likewise, it’s important that the server side of the system is open source, too.</p>
        <p>Red = Yes, directory services could be used to MITM a conversation.</p>
